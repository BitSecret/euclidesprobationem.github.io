I"¹<p>Our group is primarily computational/theoretical, with a small but growing experimental presence in collaboration with Prof. Jay Whitacre, focused on integrating machine learning approaches with automated experimentation. We have a strong commitment to using and contributing to open-source software development efforts. Weâ€™re always learning more, but the current methods/tools most commonly used in the group are summarized here.</p>
